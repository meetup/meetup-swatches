### Development setup

1. make sure you have ruby 2.0.0 installed (if you use rbenv this will be easy, .ruby-version sets the correct version for the project)
2. make sure you have the `bundler` gem installed
3. run this command to get dev dependencies:

	$ bundle install

After editing `colors.yaml` use this command to rebuild the consumable files:

	$ ruby consumer.rb
